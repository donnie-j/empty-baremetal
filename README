Here is a simple, empty ROM for turtle platform.

Place this directory at the same level as minimal-lib (until minimal-lib installs with the toolchain) and type make

The file image.elf can be renamed vmlinux and placed on an SDCard in a turtle board.  It will simply show main() exiting multiple times.  main() sets up atexit() to call a function with puts("exiting\n"); when main exits.

That's it.  Add your own code to main() and other files to Makefile.

Change the memory layout in Makefile, copying 64k 128k or rom and modifying as necessary.
